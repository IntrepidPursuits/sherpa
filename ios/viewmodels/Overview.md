The purpose of this document is to capture some of our thinking around the best practices around using view models, and to help alleviate some confusion regarding it's usage. 
These examples are meant to provide guidance, not meant to be used as a strict guideline of the only way to do it.
When in doubt, remember that the goal of introducing view models is to separate view logic and model logic.


Topics/Proposed Topics:
- [ ] Motivation behind using view models
- [x] [View model reuse accross multiple models](view-model-reuse.md)
- [ ] Should view models be value types as opposed to reference types?
- [ ] View models with two way bindings(using rx)
- [ ] View models that handle network calls
- [ ] View models that handle both network calls and persistence
- [x] [View model example from a real project](view-model-example.md)
