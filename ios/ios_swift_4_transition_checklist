# Swift 4 Transition Checklist

Provided below is a short checklist of items to complete so your project is ready to make the jump to Swift 4. 

We ask all projects to add the following checklist to the Readme file and complete the necessary items.

Transitioning Swift Wisdom to Swift 4 will be handled collectively by the iOS team. As a result, there is no need to account for Swift Wisdom related work when completing the checklist.
