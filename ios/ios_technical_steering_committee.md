## iOS Technical Steering Committee

The iOS Technical Steering Committee is responsible for driving the technical roadmap for the iOS team. The Committee will lead efforts within the iOS team to define, document and promote coding best practices, research and evaluate design patterns, architectures and frameworks, maintain the iOS team's knowledge repository and evaluate emerging technologies that may impact the iOS team. Developers across the entire iOS team are encouraged to engage with the Committee to contribute to this effort.      

Members of the Committee commit to a 6 month membership on the committee during which time they will spend on average 10 hours per month directed to fulfilling the responsibilities of the Committee. Membership of the Committee may rotate after the 6 month period.
