# Intrepid Development Principles

The following core principles represent how Intrepid approaches software development. We use these principles as a lens through which we can evaluate new technologies, tools, and processes.

### Team Alignment

There are many players on a software development team. Project managers, engineers, designers, and stakeholders all make dozens of small decisions each day that lead to a successful product. Each one of these micro-decisions is a trade off. It is important that each team member has a clear understanding of the high level project goals and success criteria as a framework for evaluating these choices.

### Plan for Change

At Intrepid we understand that uncertainty is inevitable in software development. We regard iteration as a necessary and healthy aspect of creating great products. We drive positive change by leveraging our experience and validating ideas with real-world users.

### Transparency

We reduce the impact of this uncertainty by building continuous feedback into our process. Our quality metrics, code review workflow, and agile approach are designed to give stakeholders and team members alike a clear view of progress. It is never too early to communicate risks.

### Self Assessment

Every project has its own unique set of challenges. A healthy team must examine what ceremonies, procedures, and communication styles work well for their project. It is through this self assessment that we can more accurately plan for successful delivery.
