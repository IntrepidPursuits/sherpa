# Android Git Tips

Android Studio provides a lot of support to make working with git simpler and faster.

## Branches
Android Studio shows your current branch in the lower right hand corner. Click on it to bring up a list of both local and remote branches. Note that in order for the list of remote branches to be up to date you may need to run git fetch in your terminal.

You can also use this tool to quickly switch between branches by clicking checkout on a branch you wish to switch to.

## Committing
Android Studio offers a quicker experience for adding and committing your files. Right click the root directory and select Git -> Commit directory.

![commit popup](/images/git_android_tips/commit_popup.png?raw=true)

In this super useful popup window you have the opportunity to view the files and diffs for this commit, perform checks and optimizations before committing, and add your commit message. This is definitely the recommended method for committing as it saves time and provides a bunch of useful functionality.
