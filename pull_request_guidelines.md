##Why do we do pull requests?

* Catching and reducing technical debt
* Catching mistakes
* Improving development skills
* Familiarity with the whole codebase
* Maintaining consistency

##Pull Request Software

* Reviewboard vs. Github

## Creating Pull Requests

* Pull request granularity (how big should my pull requests be?)
* Pull request “single responsibility principle”
* Pull request description
* When should screenshots be included?
* [Git process, feature branches](git_workflow_quick_reference.md)
* Assigning people vs. posting in slack

## Reviewing Pull Requests

* What type of feedback should be given?
* Correctness
* When is it necessary to run the code?

## Architecture

* When is it necessary to look at the whole codebase rather than just the diff?

## Style

* When should we be nit-picky about style? (always)

## Responding to Feedback

* When to make changes
* How to update the PR (force push)
* When master moves forward, when should the feature branch be rebased?

## Merging Pull Requests

* When to merge (how many people need to approve)
* Size of the team vs. size of the PR
* Rebase before merging with --no-ff
* Who performs the merge?
* Should the github “big green button” be used?
